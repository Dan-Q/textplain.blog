An experimental blog engine designed to deliver only plain-text content.

See it in use at: https://textplain.blog/

To use, you'll need a webserver running PHP, configured to map all requests to index.php.

Put posts in the _posts/ directory, using the filename syntax "0000-00-00 slug-goes-here.txt". Files
are reverse-sorted before listing, so you can use ISO8601 dates. Slugs must be unique.

RSS feed will be served at /feed.
