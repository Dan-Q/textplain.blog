.well-known/feeds[1] is a standard I proposed[2] last year to try to make it easier for websites to
expose a list (via OPML) of their most-relevant site-wide RSS/etc. feeds. For a blog, that might be
a feed of all of their posts, for example. Or several feeds, one of each of a variety of post types
or content categories.

The thinking is that this provides a way for sites to list feeds in a central location, independent
of their content. Which in the case of THIS blog is especially useful because without any HTML it's
impossible to use a conventional feed announcement strategy like a <link rel="alternate"> element.

Frankly it surprises ME that it took this long before I thought to add .well-known/feeds support to
textplain.blog, given that I proposed the standard in the first place. But I got there in the end.
