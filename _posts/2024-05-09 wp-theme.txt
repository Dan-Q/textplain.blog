Terence Eden has implemented a WordPress theme which makes it much-easier to run a plain text blog!
This CMS remains a much more-lightweight way to make a text/plain-only blog, of course, but I can't
deny that doing this in WordPress is pretty damn cool.

He's also managed to make it so that you can convert almost any page on his blog by simply adding a
.txt suffix to the URL. I assume it's powered by much the same technology.

Anyway, go check out his amazing work at:
