Without a <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="https://textplain.blog/feed">, RSS
readers might fail to autodiscover the RSS feed URL of a blog. That's challenging when your content
is all delivered in text/plain, because you can't HAVE a tag like that!

There's an alternative solution which I've implemented here - a Link: HTTP header. If you check the
HTTP headers sent by this site, you'll see this one -

Link: <https://textplain.blog/feed>; rel="alternate"; type="application/rss+xml"

That's the HTTP equivalent of the HTML element described above. Sadly, it doesn't seem to work well
in any of the RSS readers I've tried, but if it works in yours, I'd love for you to get in touch[1]
and tell me about it!
