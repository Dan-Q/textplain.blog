Who says a blog post has to have a title?

In his blog post on 2 May 2024[1], Terence Eden observes that the HTML specification requires that
a web page has to have a <title> (even if that title is empty, which it really shouldn't be!). But
arguing that this implies that a blog post must have a title presupposes that a blog post can only
be written in HTML...

Who says that a blog post... or a blog at all!... must be written in HTML?

I'm Dan Q[2], and this is an experimental blog and blogging engine delivered through the medium of
plain text. There's one exception: the RSS feed[3] (which is of course XML); whether or not RSS is
a requirement of a blog is yet another question, of course!

You can subscribe if you like, but the odds of a long ongoing post history here is pretty slim!
