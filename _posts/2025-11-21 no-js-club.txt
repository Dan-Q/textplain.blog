No JS (Club)
------------

There's an online club - inspired by the likes of 1mb.club, 512k.club, and 250k.club - called the
No JS Club <https://no-js.club/>. The idea is that for your site to be eligible for membership it
must use no JavaScript whatsoever.

Should textplain.blog count? It certainly has no JavaScript! But when I went through the steps to
prove this blog's eligibility, I fell at the first hurdle. The instructions to demonstrate that a
site is eligible start with running it through GMetrix to check whether any JavaScript's detected
but GMetrix totally falls over on this site! It turns out that GMetrix is designed with the hard-
coded EXPECTATION that the root page for a site will return content with the text/html (or a very
similar variant) MIME type... and a site that returns with text/plain content is unusual enough I
guess that it just... won't... run!

But obviously this site DOESN'T have any JavaScript (how could it: there's no <script> element in
plain text content!) so I submitted a ticket <https://todo.sr.ht/~shruub/no-JS.club/155> into the
club's SourceHub account and hoped for the best.

It sat there for 20 days, and for a while I thought that the account might be unmonitored, but in
the end, earlier today, it got accepted and now this site appears in the members list: one of the
newest members of No JS Club. Hurrah! Maintainer ~shruub said of the site "LGTM! Nice idea, added
:)!", so that's nice too.

No JS Club is a great reminder that a site does not need to have JavaScript to be perfectly good.
And THIS site pushes that concept just a hair further, and says that it also does not need CSS or
even HTML. Sometimes, plain text is enough.
